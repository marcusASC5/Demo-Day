    I am the Project Manager of Jobs365, and I share the jobs of Developer and Researcher with Demetris and Anthony. I was inspired to create Jobs365
    because I've watched teens struggle to secure jobs firsthand. Everyone should be able to work, no matter what their experience levels are,
    and should have access to all the jobs possible, and I wanted to be at the forefront of that belief by creating Jobs365. I am a student at 
    Edward R. Murrow High School, going into the 11th Grade, and I am open to any questions! Feel free to email me at <a href="mailto: marcus.sutton29@yahoo.com">marcus.sutton29@yahoo.com</a>.

  My name is Anthony. I was inspired to partner with Marcus to work on Jobs365 because I have had trouble myself, 
  trying to find a job because I am 16 years old. I went into the city (resume ready) looking for stores that were 
  accepting teen applicants and out of 14 stores I went to, 2 were hiring under 18.  I designed this beautiful 
  website and searched for a variety of jobs to add to the website. Working along two bright coders: Marcus and Demetris, I plan to 
  continue this website and give teens access to jobs. I am a junior  at Beacon High School and always 
  looking for oppurtunities. Feel free to email me at <a href="mailto: anthonylalllewis@gmail.com">anthonylalllewis@gmail.com</a>.
