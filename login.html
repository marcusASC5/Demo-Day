      In a Nutshell...
    </h2>
    Jobs365 is a teen-led website that is geared towards helping teens get jobs, not just in the summer, but year-round. As teens, we know the difficulty of just finding
    a job. Securing it is another story, rigidly based on factors such as experience, which a lot of teens uncontrollably have none of.
    That's where Jobs365 steps in.
    <br>
    <br>
    As opposed to having to go through a tough cycle of one-by-one searching, Jobs365 presents all the jobs applicable to a user, leaving the website 
    as the user's oyster. By using our search bar to find the type of job you're looking for, we will pull out all the results based on your 
    search, which will make finding and applying for a job much simpler. The jobs can vary from odd jobs, such as babysitting or tutoring, to positions 
    in companies, making the choices for a user extremely diverse and more resourceful. All of the information teens could possibly ever need,
    like experience needed for a specific job, is right at their fingertips.
    <br>
    <br>
    We bring the jobs to you by having people, REAL people, insert their jobs into our website, whether they come from someone in a big
    company or your friend's mom down the street, and leave them open for teens to apply for by getting in contact with the job creator.
    <br>
    <br>
    So, what are you waiting for? Let's get back to business!
